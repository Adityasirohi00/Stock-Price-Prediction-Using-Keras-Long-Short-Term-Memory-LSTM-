# Stock-Price-Prediction-Using-Keras-Long-Short-Term-Memory-LSTM-
This project demonstrates the use of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to predict the stock prices of TATA Global based on historical stock data. The model is built using Keras with LSTM layers, which are particularly well-suited for time series prediction tasks.
